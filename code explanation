KEY LOGGER

Key logger?
It works in background and it logs all your keys like if you type on your keyboard (char, numbers, space & special char). It captures all inputs and save it as a file and this file can be send a mail of the saved data to the hacker. 
This is the way the hackers use this technique 

KEY LOGGER
In python 
This refers that program written in python.

1.	Importing the keyboard Module:
	This line imports a Python module named keyboard which provides functions to interact with keyboard events.
2.	Defining the Filename:
	A variable named filename is defined to store the name of the file where the keystrokes will be logged.
3.	Writing Keystrokes to File:
	There's a function defined that is responsible for writing the pressed keys to the specified file.
	It checks if the pressed key is a character key, and if so, it writes the character to the file.
	If the pressed key is the spacebar, it writes an actual space character to the file.
	If the pressed key is a special key (e.g., Enter, Shift), it writes the key directly to the file.
4.	Starting the Keylogger:
	There's a function defined to start the keylogger.
	It sets up a listener for keyboard release events and specifies the function to call whenever a key is released.
	It waits for a specific key (e.g., 'esc') to be pressed to stop the keylogger.
5.	Main Function:
	This block of code is the entry point of the script.
	It checks if the script is being run directly and if so, it prints a message indicating that the keylogger has started and then calls the function to start the keylogger.
